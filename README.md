# KJV_Bible_Revelation_Tachistoscope

KJV_Bible_Revelation_Tachistoscope is a Windows application that I like to add to my list of Windows startup processes, so that it always runs all day long while I work.

It displays text of the KJV Book of Revelation for reflection or memorization.

It continually displays short punctuation-delimited phrases without verse numbering sequentially, each for a short duration varying with the phrase length.

It starts at a random verse, and occasionally changes to a random verse.

The tiny black text is on a transparent background to display over other apps.

Clicking on the tiny text (but not on the clear background) will exit the app.

Easier, if the app has focus, that is, if a cursor appears left of the phrase, as in shown in the screenshot.png here, then any keystroke will exit the app.

The code demonstrates making a single-instance program.

The code is all handwritten C#, which are added to an almost virgin Visual Studio Windows Form app project, which entire VS project is archived in this project.
